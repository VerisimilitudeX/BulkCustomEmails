Dear Rakuten Therapy,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing on behalf of DNAnalyzer, an open-source project and fiscally sponsored nonprofit aiming to revolutionize the field of DNA analysis using innovative AI-powered tools. Our project, created by high school students and supported by Hack Club, has the potential to uncover hidden patterns and properties of DNA sequences, such as gene expression, methylation, and transcription factors, among others.

We are truly impressed by Rakuten Medical's commitment to advancing cancer therapies and your ongoing global clinical trial with ASP-1929. Your work in developing innovative therapies for recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is remarkable. Additionally, the early-phase clinical trials investigating ASP-1929 in combination with anti-PD1 in multiple tumor types show great promise.

We believe that a partnership between DNAnalyzer and Rakuten Therapy could lead to valuable collaborations and advancements in DNA analysis. We would greatly appreciate your expertise and guidance in incorporating your cutting-edge techniques and research findings into our platform. By leveraging your insights and resources, we can enhance the capabilities of DNAnalyzer, allowing us to provide more comprehensive and accurate analysis for a variety of genetic disorders.

However, we understand that partnerships may not always be feasible. If that is the case with Rakuten Therapy, we would highly appreciate any guidance or resources you could provide us with. As a nonprofit organization, we rely on the support and knowledge of experts like yourselves to further develop and refine our platform. Any information or mentorship you could offer us would be invaluable.

Thank you for considering this partnership opportunity with DNAnalyzer. We are excited about the possibility of working together to revolutionize DNA analysis and contribute to the advancement of medical research. We look forward to hearing from you and discussing how we can collaborate for the greater good.

Warm regards,

[CEO Name]
